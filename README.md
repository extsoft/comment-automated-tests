# Comments automated tests
This repo provides a sample set of automated tests for [http://commentssprintone.azurewebsites.net]() application.

## Used tools
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) as a programming language
- [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as a build system
- [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru) as a reporting engine
- [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org) as a WEB automation framework
- [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/) as a tests runner
- [Sunshine](https://github.com/tatools/sunshine/) as a suite manager for TestNG
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) as an infrastructure manager

# Running the tests
There are two supported browsers:
- `firefox` means [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org)
- `chrome` means [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

The tests are going to connect to a remote driver. It can be either a WebDriver run as a 
 standalone process ([instructions](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver#running-chromedriver-as-a-standalone-process) for `ChromeDriver`) or [Selenium Grid](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp).

Also, please pay attention to [configuration options](#configuration-options) and [reporting](#reporting).

## Docker
**Using local browser driver**
```bash
docker run -it \
       --net=host \
       --env SELENIUM_URL=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:4444 \
       --env BROWSER=firefox \
       --volume $(pwd)/allure-results:/jcat/allure-results \
       extsoft/jcat:latest
```

As the browser driver is run on the localhost, we have to give proper URL for `SELENIUM_URL` option. Docker provides several networking features for each OS which allow binding of host machine's hostname into a container. As the result, if you bind a container to host's network with `--net=host` and want access host's resources, correct hostname is
- `docker.for.win.localhost` for Windows
- `docker.for.mac.localhost` for OSX
- `localhost` for Linux

**Using Selenium Grid**
```bash
docker run -it \
       --env SELENIUM_URL=http://selenium-hub:4444/wd/hub \
       --env BROWSER=firefox \
       --volume $(pwd)/allure-results:/jcat/allure-results \
       extsoft/jcat:latest
```
If Selenium Grid is run on your local environment using docker, you have to add `--net=<grid network>` to the command above.

## From source code
1. Clone the repo
2. Package tests  with `mvn clean package` (a JAR file is located under `target` directory and is named like `comments-at-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar` , where `x.x.x` is a `version` property from [pom.xml](pom.xml)).
3. Run tests with `java -jar comments-at-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

For instance,
```bash
java -Dbrowser=firefox -Dselenium-url=http://127.0.0.1:4444 \
     -jar comments-at-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
``` 
runs tests on Firefox browser using `geckodriver` started on `4444` port.

## Configuration options
Environment variable (Docker) | System property (Java) | Options | Default value (Docker / Java) | Description
---|---|---|---|---
`BROWSER` | `browser` | either`chrome` or `firefox` | `chrome` / `chrome` | A browser for testing
`SELENIUM_URL` | `selenium-url` |Any remote URL | `http://selenium-hub:4444/wd/hub` / `http://localhost:9515` | An URL to remove driver or Selenium Grid

## Reporting
The [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru) files are stored to `allure-results` directory within the directory where you run the tests. Just run `allure serve` to see the Allure HTML report.
